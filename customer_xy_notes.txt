🧩 Problem Summary
A new error appeared in the Domain Management section of the marketing automation platform (Pardot/MCAE). The SSL Status of a tracker domain (e.g., grow.example.com) was marked as "ERROR".

It appeared as though the SSL certificate might have expired or been misconfigured.

🔍 Initial Investigation
The SSL certificate was checked using SSLShopper's SSL Checker (https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html). 

Results showed:
- The certificate was valid and correctly installed.
- It was set to expire in over 20 days.
- Intermediate certificates were also present and complete.
- The domain name matched the certificate.

This indicated no technical issue on the domain or certificate level.

🔎 Analysis
Further research, including community insights (e.g., Salesforce Trailblazer forums), suggests:
- The SSL Status: ERROR is often caused by a known platform-side issue where Salesforce’s internal certificate check process gets stuck or fails to update.
- This issue does not indicate an actual SSL failure.
- Only Salesforce Support can reset the SSL status using an internal backend tool.

✅ Solution
A support ticket was opened with Salesforce, referencing this known issue.

Salesforce confirmed that the problem was not related to the certificate itself, but due to a glitch in their internal validation system.
They manually reset the SSL status on their end, and the domain now shows “Enabled” again in Domain Management.

💡 Recommendation
If this error reappears in the future:

First verify the SSL certificate using an external checker (e.g., SSLShopper).

If the certificate is valid and correctly configured, open a support ticket with Salesforce.

Mention that this is a known system error and that the status needs to be manually reset on their side.

📝 Important:
SSL certificates are not managed within Pardot. They are hosted on the infrastructure of the web provider (e.g., CMS or hosting platform). Pardot only accesses and checks them periodically.
